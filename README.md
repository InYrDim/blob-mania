## Technologies

To create this website, I utilized Fullstack JavaScript with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). For other dependencies, you can see on `package.json` file.

## Data Source

To fill this site with comic, I implemented a web scraping process. This involved extracting relevant information from the popular [bato.to](https://bato.to/) website.

I have separate repository for the scrapper

### **Important Note**

I think the data in _[bato.to](https://bato.to/)_ site is coming from uploader of that page.Since uploader can be anyone, that means the data/comic may duplicated or maybe not relevent with name or genres and so on.
